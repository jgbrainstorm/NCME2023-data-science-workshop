### Introduction

Digitally Based Assessments (DBAs) offer promising opportunities of insights into test takersâ€™ response process information. Yet the significantly increased volume, velocity, and variety of data pose new challenges to psychometricians for handling, analyzing, and interpreting the data to materialize their value. Data science is an emerging interdisciplinary field aimed at obtaining such insights from structured and unstructured data. Data science techniques and practices could and should be adopted into the toolkit of next-generation psychometrics to help address the data challenges accompanying DBAs. This workshop intends to provide basic data science skills and modeling strategies in the context of DBAs and help psychometricians and data analysts become better equipped to work with the increasingly big and complex data. The workshop will use Python, the dominant programming language in data science, and follow the latest developments in Python machine learning packages.
